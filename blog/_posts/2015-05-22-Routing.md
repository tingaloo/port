# What is a link?

A link is a connection between two points. We have a hyperlink to access a specific website. In terms of creating a website, we need to *route* CRUD actions to the proper link.

Creating any new url requires specifying a particular route path and following RESTful practices.

## How to Use

I see routing as a way my controller talks to my views. It is the connection that literally "routes" a link to an action. Good news is that Rails is quick to point out whether or not a route exists or not. And it is as just as easy to create a route in routes.rb

```ruby
 Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: 'books#index'
  devise_for :users
  resources :users
  resources :book_checkouts
  resources :books
  get '/airdrop', to: 'books#airdrop'
  get '/test_index', to: 'books#test_index'
  get '/about', to: 'books#about'
  # get 'books/index'
 end
```

This is my example routes file. Basically it generates URLs for actions that need a route. The models have routes for their actions. And for my custom actions, I wrote specific 'gets' to route custom actions.

## Rake Routes

```ruby
root GET    /                                  books#index
        new_user_session GET    /users/sign_in(.:format)           devise/sessions#new
            user_session POST   /users/sign_in(.:format)           devise/sessions#create
    destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out(.:format)          devise/sessions#destroy
           user_password POST   /users/password(.:format)          devise/passwords#create
       new_user_password GET    /users/password/new(.:format)      devise/passwords#new
      edit_user_password GET    /users/password/edit(.:format)     devise/passwords#edit
                         PATCH  /users/password(.:format)          devise/passwords#update
                         PUT    /users/password(.:format)          devise/passwords#update
cancel_user_registration GET    /users/cancel(.:format)            devise/registrations#cancel
       user_registration POST   /users(.:format)                   devise/registrations#create
   new_user_registration GET    /users/sign_up(.:format)           devise/registrations#new
  edit_user_registration GET    /users/edit(.:format)              devise/registrations#edit
                         PATCH  /users(.:format)                   devise/registrations#update
                         PUT    /users(.:format)                   devise/registrations#update
                         DELETE /users(.:format)                   devise/registrations#destroy
                   users GET    /users(.:format)                   users#index
                         POST   /users(.:format)                   users#create
                new_user GET    /users/new(.:format)               users#new
               edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format)          users#edit
                    user GET    /users/:id(.:format)               users#show
                         PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)               users#update
                         PUT    /users/:id(.:format)               users#update
                         DELETE /users/:id(.:format)               users#destroy

```
With the Devise module, rake routes outputs this if the routes are setup properly.
