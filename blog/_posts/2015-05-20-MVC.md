## We've Heard This Before

I did not understand the meaning of MVC until I played with multiple Rails projects. Model View Controller, model view Controller. Model Model View. With so many files, it is easy to loose track of the file you were just working on. So MVC serves as a file structure to help organize you and your project.

Model is the database. View is what everyone sees. Controller is the thing that talks with the Model and View.

## Just a Concept
It is a concept that is worth understanding to get the most out of Rails. I always have places where I could make my code much more clean. It is a concept that in practice will click, but you know you can always do better.

## By Example
The Index page needs access to a database of Users. Cool, our view page speaks HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. Now we want to implement some Ruby code so it can speak RUBY to our database. Ruby is our backend language both the controller and model speak. Our index file is renamed index.html.erb, so we can EMBED RUBY code.

```ruby
# User Controller
def index
  @users = User.all
end
```

Then we reference that in our index page like this.

```html
<!-- index.html.erb -->
<% @users.each do |user| %>
    <%= user.first_name %>
    <%= user.last_name %>
<% end %>
```

The controller passes the instance variable to the view layer. The view layer can use Ruby logic here to communicate with the instance variable and retrieve the necessary information.
