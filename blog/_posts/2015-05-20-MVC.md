Now, I have managed to deploy multiple applications. I am proud of my NovelShare application because I worked on that mostly from scratch without tutorials.

## Am I Ready?

I have sufficient knowledge for a Junior Rails or Junior Ruby position. In between apps, I would reinforce my Ruby expertise with Exercism.io, CodeKata, and RubyKoans.

I may not be the perfect Ruby coder, but I do know what it looks like to create a well-designed Ruby program.
