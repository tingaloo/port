# Before Google Docs
There was Microsoft Word, the ultimate word processor. It was reliable, saved before quitting. Had spell check, word count, font managing. Basically it was better than notepad.

#Then came Google Docs,
A cloud based solution to writing documents. A word processor that auto-saves old drafts, encourages collaboration.

Basically it was more reliable than anything we had before.

Github is a lot like Google Docs, you collaborate with others. There are also many repositories to check out.


# Rinse and Repeat

1. git status
2. git checkout -b feature_X
3. CODING IN PROGRESS
4. git status
5. git add .
6. git commit -am "Feature X implemented"
7. git checkout master
8. git merge feature_X
9. git status
10. git checkout -b feature_Y
11. Step 3 and on.

# Allow me to explain

Github is more complex than Google Docs because there is lots of code.

# A Few Cons
It is not intuitive, everything starts in the command line. There is a GUI alternative, but it is still frustrating. And all my repositories (projects) are public unless I pay a subscription.
