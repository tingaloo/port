## TL;DR ActiveRecord is the Rails database framework. The purpose of this post is to effectively describe models to better understand how to code better.

This is the bare minimum to know what ActiveRecord is and its capabilities.

# 2. An example?

In a basic blog application, your ActiveRecord consists of three models. Users, posts, and comments.

1. Visitor #creates a User.
2. @user saved in User database.
3. Visitor is signed_in as @user
4. @user #creates a Post
5. @post saved in Post database.
6. Visitor2 #creates a User.
7. @user2 gets saved in User database.
8. @user2 navigates to @post.
9. @user2 #creates a Comment on @post.
10. @comment saved in Comment database in @post.

There are three relational models that interact with each other. The models will look something like this.

```ruby
 # assets/app/models/

 # user.rb
 class User
   has_many :posts
   has_many :comments
 end

 # post.rb
 class Post
   belongs_to :users
   has_many :comments
 end

 # comment.rb
 class Comment
   belongs_to :users
   belongs_to :posts
 end
```

# 3. A More Complicated example.

What comes to mind is Spree, a Rails e-commerce platform.

# 4. What's my Process?

Create a base model, CamelCase and SINGULAR

```shell
 rails g model CompletedTask
```

Then I navigate to db/migrations and edit the latest file.

```shell
 rake db:migrate
```

Then I restart rails server to update the application


# 5. What is a model again?

A model is


ActiveRecord also produces something like this for a model.

```ruby
 class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

 end
 #if it does not inherit ActiveRecord::Base, it is NOT STORED.
```

```shell
>> Book.inspect

 Book(id: integer, title: string, author: string, just_added: boolean, available: boolean, checkout_counter: integer, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime, user_id: integer, condition: string, checkout_user_id: integer, cover_file_name: string, cover_content_type: string, cover_file_size: integer, cover_updated_at: datetime)
```

And what it looks like without inheriting ActiveRecord

```ruby
 class Book
 # No inheritance
```

```shell
 >>Book.inspect

 "Book"
```


# Why are more Models better?

Rule #1, Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.

This is for organizing logic, or making concepts easier to find and read.
