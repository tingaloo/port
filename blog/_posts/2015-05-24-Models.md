I had no idea how complicated models were until I reached ActiveRecord. Models house the database, which houses classes and attributes. The hard part was knowing how to request a specific piece of data at the correct place. Aside from that, still learning.

```ruby
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user, counter_cache: true
  validates :title, presence: true, length: {minimum: 3}
  validates :author, presence: true

  has_many :book_checkouts, dependent: :destroy

  def available? # the presenter calls this
    if most_recent_checkout
      most_recent_checkout.returned?
    else
      true
    end
  end

  def most_recent_checkout
    book_checkouts.order('return_deadline desc').first
  end


  private

  def destroy_book_checkouts
    BookCheckout.delete_all "book_id = #{id}"
  end
end
```

This is my book model from Novelshare. It has its own validations and methods. The methods are ways other controllers or presenters can call the model.

ActiveRecord also produces something like this for a model.

```ruby
 class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
```

```shell
>> Book.inspect

 Book(id: integer, title: string, author: string, just_added: boolean, available: boolean, checkout_counter: integer, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime, user_id: integer, condition: string, checkout_user_id: integer, cover_file_name: string, cover_content_type: string, cover_file_size: integer, cover_updated_at: datetime)
```

And what it looks like without inheriting ActiveRecord

```ruby
 class Book
```

```shell
 >>Book.inspect

 "Book"
```

The attributes are generated through rails commands, specifically migrations. Anytime I alter the tables, I have to migrate the database and restart the server.
Otherwise the Rails project is communicating with a database that isn't up to date, which can cause problems.

# Make More Models

Models are good for storing data, and abstracting data away from sensitive areas (controller). I was under the impression creating more models was expensive, but in reality making more just makes cleaner code. And objects are not too expensive either. It is only the complexity that grows and the relationships between models.
