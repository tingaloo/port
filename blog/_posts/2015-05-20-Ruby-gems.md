# TL;DR Gems are outside plugins that give you extra features at the cost of compatibility. Use them wisely and with purpose.

I would search for a gem at rubygems.org

Then I would check both source code and documentation and see if it is still maintained.

Afterwards copy the latest version and bundle install.

## Gemfile.rb


```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '2.2.1'
gem 'rails', '4.2.0'
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0'
gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.1.0'
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'turbolinks'
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.0'
group :development, :test do
  gem 'byebug'
  gem 'web-console', '~> 2.0'
  gem 'spring'
end
gem 'devise'
gem 'foundation-rails'
gem 'pg'
gem 'simple_form'

```

## Compatibilities.

Gems are considered magic, because we don't really read its actual source code. We read the documentation and use the methods provided, that is if the documentation is solid.

## Analogy

I have played a good amount of Fallout: New Vegas. I tried installing lots of mods and the game would crash on loadup. The mod manager had at least 14 mods running with a few mod conflicts. I had to immediately remove some of the larger mods for the game to run. But the point is to simply use what you must, or run into dependency issues.
