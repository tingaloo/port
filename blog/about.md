    <h1> What is this place? </h1>
    <p> I think of it as a workspace to collect my thoughts and ideas.
    The grid system is efficient in organizing my posts. My mind is a clusterfuck of
    ideas running at night and dreams that are soon forgotten.
    <br>
    This grey area is part diary, part process, and part discovery. I am still unsure
    of myself and how to press forward. I want to understand myself.
