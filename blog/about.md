## **Fact**: This blog is written for me.

It is a personal blog. It details MY challenges and experiences. I hope this makes me a stronger web developer. I will document my errors and my own solutions.

## **Fact**: Part Diary

Some subjects can get personal, and a  And it would be good to understand what I can do.

## **Fact**: Semi-Technical

I will be copying and pasting code. Most of the technical aspects will be linked. I am going to break it down in a more layman's process.


## Chances are this can be written for you also.

I am a Economics graduate looking for a web development job. There are others like me.

## My dream job is creating futuristic projects with like-minded people on my cool laptop.

I want to be part of a team that really digs the process of web development. From installing all the dependencies to explaining it casually to a client. If the team is enthusiastic and the project is actually solving a real problem, I know I made it.

## And I like biking, urban exploring, driving to beaches, hiking.
