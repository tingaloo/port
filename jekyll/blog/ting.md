# Resume

I am looking for a job after all.

I will tell you this much.
I would like to be a full stack, but i think the inner workings of a website define how
a website looks.

The use-cases, the repetition of data entry by the client. Is this a piece of software
that is worth it for the client to learn?

I try to remember to ask the right questions.
